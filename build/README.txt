## About Beaker-ng

Beaker-ng is an experimental peer-to-peer Web browser. It adds new APIs for building hostless applications, 
while remaining compatible with the rest of the Web. It can use the dat:// and hyper:// URL schemes/protocols.

It is a fork of the original Beaker Browser, which can be found here > https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker

See documentation on how to use it at the gitbook here > https://beaker-browser.gitbook.io/

And at the resurrected website here > https://thorium.rocks/docs.beakerbrowser.com/
